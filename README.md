### R-Plots-Detection
- Strict Priority Queueing: Output data files provided by the NS3 automation are analyze through visualization by using useful cleaner graphs.
- Compression Middlebox: Output data files via NS3 automation for Compression on two experiments for packet sizes and packet lengths

#### About:
The following R scripts are designed to plot experiments from middleboxes present in a current network flow. The plots
helps detecting this kind of middleboxes by studying its nature and how it affect network traffic and distribution of packets
within the network.
